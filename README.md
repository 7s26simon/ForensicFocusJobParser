This script lets you search for jobs in your area that have been posted up on ForensicFocus.com. The script requires beautifulsoup to be installed and the intention is that you enter your email address/password into the script, along with locations in which you're looking for a job e.g London, Manchester, Birmingham etc.

The script is intended to be used in conjunction with Windows Task Scheduler, so that it can parse the jobs page for a particular area and email you instantly to let you know there is a job posted that matches your criteria.
